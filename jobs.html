            <p class="jobE"> Similar to the front-end job, this job also requires at least 3 years of experience in the field however it also has much steeper requirements when it comes to required skills. This of course comes with a quite a bit higher salary of 60k pounds a year.<br>
            This job offer has also been posted by a private company however in this case it would mostly include dealing with mobile development.

            <p class="jobS">I think that It's interesting how back end jobs like this one compare with their front-end counterparts. It is clear to see that front-end development is much more appealing for beginning web developers and that the amount of jobs in that field is higher than in the case of back end. That reason behind it could be in the fact that it is quite easy for one company to host multiple domains and websites at once while developing an interesting website is process that requires quite a lot of creativity. However, it is noteworthy that vacancies aimed at back-end developers are usually much better salaried and more stable than their front-end counterparts. It is also worth noting that most web-development jobs, whether back or front end, require strong team working and communication skills. The necessity of working in a team is not always obvious to beginning programmers or developers. Strong communication skills are very valued on jobs market nowadays and I just wanted to underline that  only learning programming is often not enough to land the really top-end jobs.</p>
